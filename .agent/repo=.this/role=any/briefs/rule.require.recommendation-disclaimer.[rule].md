# rule.require.recommendation-disclaimer

# tldr

## severity: blocker

every recommendation brief must carry a best-effort disclaimer: the recommendation is to the best
of our knowledge from the info found, carries no guarantee of success, and must be reviewed by a
licensed professional against the reader's own real scenario before reliance.

a recommendation that omits this disclaimer overstates its own authority. these briefs are research
groundwork, not professional advice — the disclaimer keeps that boundary explicit so a reader never
mistakes a cited recommendation for a sign-off.

## .what

any brief that makes a **recommendation** — a `rule.prefer.*`, a `rule.avoid.*`, a `howto.*` that
steers a design choice, or any brief that tells the reader what they *should do* — must include a
best-effort disclaimer near the top (in or right after the `## .what`, before the substance).

this stacks on top of, and is distinct from, the `motto.not-legal-advice` framework. the not-legal-
advice line says "this is not advice"; the recommendation disclaimer adds three affirmative
qualifiers: **best-knowledge**, **no guarantee**, and **review-by-a-real-professional-for-your-real-
scenario**.

## .why

- a recommendation reads as more authoritative than a neutral definition or hazard map — it tells the
  reader what to do. that authority must be bounded, or the reader may treat cited research as a
  professional sign-off.
- the briefs are built from public info found via web research. that info can be stale, incomplete,
  jurisdiction-specific, or wrong for a reader's exact facts. the recommendation may be sound in
  general and wrong for a specific scenario.
- a licensed professional (attorney, CPA, licensed advisor) who tests the recommendation against the
  reader's **actual** facts is the only thing that converts groundwork into reliance-grade advice.
  the disclaimer names that step as required, not optional.

## severity: blocker

a recommendation brief without the disclaimer overstates its authority and invites unearned reliance.
the cost of the omission is a reader who acts on a cited recommendation as if it were vetted for their
scenario — the exact failure mode the whole research discipline exists to prevent. the disclaimer is
one paragraph; its absence is a blocker.

## .where

applies to any brief in `.agent/**` or `src/domain.roles/**/briefs/**` that makes a recommendation:

- every `rule.prefer.*` and `rule.avoid.*` brief
- every `howto.*` brief that recommends a design or a course of action
- any `define.*` / `ref.*` brief whose body issues a "you should / we recommend" steer

it does **not** apply to purely neutral artifacts that make no recommendation — a bare `define.*`
term brief, a `hazard.*` map that only describes risk, or a nav rollup (`_.glossary`, `_.catalogue`).

## .how

place the disclaimer as a blockquote near the top of the brief (in or just after `## .what`). the
disclaimer must express all three qualifiers. a canonical form:

```md
> **recommendation disclaimer.** this recommendation is offered to the best of our knowledge, based
> on the information found in research — it carries **no guarantee of success or outcome**, and it must
> be reviewed by a licensed professional (attorney / CPA / licensed advisor) against your own real
> scenario and current law before any reliance. it is groundwork for that review, not a substitute
> for it.
```

exact text may vary, but it must convey all three: (1) **best knowledge / info found**, (2) **no
guarantee**, and (3) **must be reviewed by a real, licensed professional for the reader's real
scenario**.

## .enforcement

- a recommendation brief without the disclaimer = **blocker**
- a disclaimer that omits any of the three qualifiers (best-knowledge, no-guarantee, review-by-real-
  professional-for-real-scenario) = **blocker**
