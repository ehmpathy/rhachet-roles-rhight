# defect: mvsafe does not handle brackets in filenames

## .what

`rhx mvsafe` fails to match files with `[` or `]` in their names.

## .repro

```bash
# file exists
cat 'src/domain.roles/permiter/briefs/ref.permit-requires-local-contractor.[ref].md'
# works - file contents displayed

# mvsafe fails to find it
rhx mvsafe 'src/domain.roles/permiter/briefs/ref.permit-requires-local-contractor.[ref].md' 'src/domain.roles/permiter/briefs/ref.permit-requires-local-license.[ref].md'
# result: files: 0, moved: (none)

# glob also fails
rhx globsafe --pattern 'src/domain.roles/permiter/briefs/ref.permit-requires*'
# result: files: 0
```

## .root cause (suspected)

the skill likely uses shell glob or a glob library that interprets `[` and `]` as character class patterns rather than literal characters.

for example:
- `[ref]` is interpreted as "match any of r, e, or f"
- instead of literal `[ref]`

## .workaround used

```bash
cat 'src/...old.[ref].md' | rhx teesafe 'src/...new.[ref].md'
rm 'src/...old.[ref].md'
```

## .expected behavior

mvsafe should treat paths as literal strings when passed as arguments, not glob patterns.

## .affected skills

- `rhx mvsafe`
- `rhx rmsafe` (same issue)
- `rhx globsafe` (same issue)

## .suggested fix

1. escape brackets before glob expansion, OR
2. add `--literal` flag to treat path as literal, OR
3. use a different mechanism for single-file operations vs glob patterns
